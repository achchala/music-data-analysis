Now I'm reeling and I might\nBreak the windows, let myself back in\nLost it for a minute there\nGet my shit together, it's whatever, but I could die\nKnowing that you're probably out somewhere\nWhile I'm in my underwear\nEating through my feelings, I'm still reeling, but it's fine\nOh, thank God that you're not seeing this\nI'll spare you from everything\nIf you would still have me, I'll be waiting all my life\nOh-oh\n\nI bet all my money that I will\nLose to you and hand you my life (Ooh)\nHere's to hoping you're worth all my time (I hope you're worth my time)\nI might barely know you, but still (Still)\nDon't love you yet, but probably will (Will)\nTurn me into something tragic\nJust for you, I let it happen\nI bet all my money that I will (I'm letting it)\nLose to you and hand you my life (I'm letting it, ooh)\nHere's to hoping you're worth all my time (I hope you're worth my time; I'm letting it)\nI might barely know you, but still (Still)\nDon't love you yet, but probably will (Will)\nTurn me into something tragic\nJust for you, I let it happen (I'm letting it, I'm letting it)\n\n(Whatever) I let it happen\n(Whatever) I let it happen\n(Whatever) I let it happen\nI let it happen (I'm letting it, I'm letting it)"

Was I self-appointed?\nI slowly moved into your house\nAll of my dark blue, covered it for you\nBut I'm just so embarrassed now\n\nAnd you did all that I wouldn't do, erasing lines around us\nI held my head, I used to hold you but now I'll walk around us\nAnd I can't lie and claim confused when I know just what happened\nYou got bored and I felt us\u0435d, now I'm all sad about it\n\nWhat did I ask for that I now pay for?\nWould it have killed you to explain\nThat you w\u0435ren't ready? And you nearly told me\nAnd, still, I gave you I, gave you I gave you I\nMy honest commitment, I sat and listened\nI was your floorboard, holdin' it down\nYou went off running away from something\nThat I have nothing to do with now\n\nAnd you did all that I'd never do, erasing time around us\nI held my breath, I used to hold you but now I'll walk around us\nAnd could you not deny the truth? 'Cause I know just what happened\nYou got bored and I felt used, now I'm all sad about it\n\nWhen did you slip through my fingers, did I ever have you?\nWas I just a placeholder to fill the hole inside you?\nI've been feeling sick but I should help myself, not call you\nNothing left to say 'cause you're not over her, now, are you?\n\nAnd you did all that I wouldn't do, erasing lines around us\nI held my head, I used to hold you but now I'll walk around us\nAnd I won't lie and claim confused when I know just what happened\nYou got bored and I felt used, now I'm all sad about it\n\nOh, you got bored and I felt used, now I'm all sad about it\nOh, you got bored and I felt used, now I'm all sad about it\nOh, you got bored and I felt used, now I'm so sad about it"
